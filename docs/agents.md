# Agents

Two ways for an agent to work on a notes tree: through the files, when
it runs on the box, or through MCP, when it does not. Both end at the
same place — every write is merged into the note's document, shown live
to open clients, written back to the file, and committed to git under an
identifiable author.

## The filesystem path

Bind-mount the tree (or a space) into the agent's container and let it
work on files with the tools it already has:

```yaml
services:
  agent:
    volumes:
      - ./notes/homelab:/notes:rw
```

An agent told "document the homelab" then reads the tree with `rg` and
`cat`, writes `.md` files, links them with `[[wikilinks]]`, and the
server picks everything up: files are indexed, links resolve, backlinks
appear. No manual fixup, no API to learn. The rules the agent follows
are in [file-format.md](file-format.md) and, per space, in its
`CONVENTIONS.md` (below).

What the agent should know:

- Do not invent frontmatter ids. A file without `id` gets one on its
  next scan; a file with an invented id keeps it forever, including the
  collisions.
- The optional frontmatter keys the server reads are `order`, `trusted`
  and `aliases` (an inline list, `aliases: [Mom, Margaret]`, giving the
  note extra names `[[links]]` resolve by — see [links.md](links.md)).
- Write files completely and finish, or write to a temporary name and
  `mv` into place; a file still being written is indexed after it
  settles.
- `mv` moves the note and rewrites its inbound links; `rm` deletes it
  with a 30-day recovery window; `cp` creates a new note with a fresh
  id.
- A write by an agent on the files is attributed to the author
  `filesystem`, the same as any editor. If attribution matters, use the
  MCP path.

### CONVENTIONS.md

Each space can carry a conventions file at its root, written for the
humans and agents that work on it: the frontmatter contract, wikilink
syntax, the `_assets` convention, and the space's actual folder
structure. Generate it with:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://notes.example.com/api/spaces/homelab/conventions
```

The file lands as `<space>/CONVENTIONS.md` — an ordinary note. An
existing file is returned untouched unless the body is
`{"refresh": true}`; regenerating is never accidental. Point the agent
at it first: an empty space plus a conventions file is a complete brief.

## The MCP path

Agents not on the box use the MCP server at `POST /mcp` (Streamable
HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0). It is the same loop with attribution: every write
is an operation authored `agent:<label>`, live for open clients, durable
through write-back, and committed to git under the label.

### Tokens

An agent authenticates with a token, minted by the owner on the Agents
page in settings (`/settings/agents`: the MCP URL with a copy button,
the keys with their scope and last use, create and revoke) or at the
API:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"label":"homelab-docs","spaces":["homelab"],"can_write":true}' \
  https://notes.example.com/api/agents
```

The answer carries the secret once:

```json
{"id":"01J...","label":"homelab-docs","spaces":["homelab"],"can_write":true,"token":"ya_..."}
```

Tokens are not user sessions: no password, no refresh flow, no expiry.
A token sees exactly its listed spaces, may write only when
`can_write`, is listed with its last use at `GET /api/agents`, and is
revoked at `DELETE /api/agents/{id}` — the next request with it fails.
Only the secret's hash is stored. Every use is logged.

Point an MCP client at the server with the token as a bearer header:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yana": {
      "url": "https://notes.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ya_..."}
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `list_spaces()` | the token's spaces with note counts |
| `list_tree(space, path?)` | a space's notes as a nested tree, optionally under a prefix |
| `read_note(note)` | one note by id (26-character ULID) or path; metadata and content |
| `write_note(space, path, content, agent_label?)` | create or replace a note |
| `append_note(note, content, agent_label?)` | append to an existing note |
| `search_notes(query, space?, limit?)` | full-text search within the token's scope |
| `move_note(note, new_path)` | move or rename, rewriting inbound links |

`agent_label` defaults to the token's label. It lets one token name the
job in front of it, and it is what lands in the note's history and git:
the CRDT author and the commit author are both `agent:<label>`.

Writes are edits to the note's document, not file overwrites: an agent
rewriting a note while a phone client has it open updates the phone
live, and any typing in flight merges rather than conflicting. Writes
are rate-limited per label (`YANA_AGENT_RATE`, default 30 a minute); a
refused write says so and can be retried later. All paths go through
the same path-safety module as every other writer, so traversal
attempts are rejected, not followed.

## Attribution and undo

`note_updates.author` records `agent:<label>` for every MCP write, and
the git window commits those files under `<label> <agent@local>` — a
human's edits never mix into an agent's commit. To undo an agent's
work: revert its commit in the notes repository (`git revert`), or
restore a single note from its revision list in the UI. Both are one
action.

| Route | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/agents` | list tokens (owner only) |
| `POST /api/agents` | `{label, spaces, can_write}` — mints a token, owner only |
| `DELETE /api/agents/{id}` | revokes it immediately, owner only |
| `POST /api/spaces/{space}/conventions` | writes or refreshes the space's `CONVENTIONS.md` |
