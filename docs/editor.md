# The editor

The browser client is a Preact app around a CodeMirror 6 editor. A note
opens as its rendered view; the editor is a mode you step into and out
of. What follows is what the client does and which endpoints it leans
on.

## The shell

One component tree, three layouts, picked by width:

| Width | Layout |
|---|---|
| under 720px | Phone. One pane, no tab strip. The sidebar is a drawer; a bar along the bottom has Notes, Search, Today and New. A note reads or edits, never both; while editing, a formatting bar replaces the bottom bar. |
| 720 to 1023px | Tablet. The drawer stays; the top bar has room for New and Today. The tab strip sits above the note. Read, Edit and Split are all available. |
| 1024px and up | Desktop. The sidebar is a column that collapses from the top-left button; the tab strip sits above the note; Split puts the editor beside the render; the content area splits into two panes. |

The sidebar holds search (full text with operators — `tag:`, `path:`,
`space:`, `is:`, `has:`, `author:`, `before:`, `after:`, a `-` to
exclude, quotes for a phrase — or a regular expression with the `.*`
switch when the server has ripgrep), the tree, the saved searches, and
the links to the tag index, the unresolved-link report, the trash, and
settings. Search results replace the tree while a query is typed. A
space you belong to shows in the tree even before it holds a note, with
the `+` to start one, and so does a folder that holds no note yet.

Spaces and folders open and close from their row; the space header is
the toggle, with the note count beside the name. Folders start closed
and spaces open, and what was opened is remembered per browser
(`yana.tree.open` holds the folders opened, `yana.tree.closed` the
spaces closed, so an empty store is the default). Opening a note by any
way other than a click in the tree (search, a wikilink, the switcher,
the URL) opens its space and the folders above it and scrolls the row
into view; a click in the tree never reopens what was just closed. A
space's menu collapses or expands every folder in it, and the palette
does the same across the tree. A drag held over a closed folder or
space for a moment opens it.

Pinned notes and folders sit at the top of the tree, above the spaces.
A pinned folder is the folder, collapsible, with everything in it. Pins
are a preference of the browser (`yana.pins` in `localStorage`, beside
the recents), never a file in the tree: the tree is the folders and the
notes and nothing else. Pin from a note's overflow menu, the palette,
or the row's actions in the tree; the home page lists the pins too.

The home page is the three things people come here to do — New note,
Capture, Today — then the pins and the recently opened notes. The
shortcuts are one palette entry (Keyboard shortcuts), not a panel on the
home page.

Light and dark themes follow the system unless picked in the account menu
(top right) or on the Appearance page in settings, which also sets the
text size (small, normal, large), the line width (narrow, normal, wide),
the mode notes open in, the hide-syntax switch, and the sidebar density.
Those, the sidebar state, what the tree has open, the open tabs, the display name, the default spaces and the
recently opened notes are kept per browser in `localStorage` under
`yana.*`; nothing else is stored there. Everything in `prefs.ts` reads
the same keys, so a preference set in settings is what the shell and the
editor use after a reload, and while the page is open.

## Tabs

On a tablet or a desktop, notes open in tabs along the top of the
content pane. A phone has no strip: it shows one note, and the drawer
and the bottom bar do the switching.

- **Preview.** A click in the tree, a search hit, a recent note or a
  wikilink opens the note in the preview tab (its title in italics),
  replacing whatever the preview tab showed. Editing the note,
  double-clicking the tab, or Keep open on its menu makes it a normal
  tab. There is at most one preview tab, so browsing does not pile up
  tabs.
- **New tabs.** `Mod`-click or middle-click on a tree row, a search hit,
  a backlink, a task, an activity entry, a recent note or a wikilink
  opens it in a new tab behind the current one. Open in new tab is on
  the tree's note menu and on a wikilink's right-click menu. New notes
  and the daily note open in a new tab of their own.
- **The menu.** Right-click a tab, or hold it on a touch screen: Close,
  Close others, Close to the right, Keep open, Pin tab. Pinned tabs sit
  leftmost, show only an icon, and do not close with the close key. Tabs
  drag to reorder, and a note dragged from the tree onto the strip opens
  where it lands. A middle-click closes a tab.
- **The address.** The URL is always the active tab's note, so links,
  refresh and back and forward keep working; back and forward move
  through the notes a tab showed. Tasks, tags, activity, settings, the
  trash and home are tabs too, one of each: opening Tasks again, or
  changing its filters, moves the Tasks tab rather than adding one.
- **One editor.** Only the active tab's note is mounted and holds a
  realtime session; the others are records (note, mode, scroll position,
  preview, pinned). Switching remounts the note, reconnects its session,
  and puts it back in the mode and at the scroll position it was left
  in. The tabs, their order and the active one are kept per browser
  (`yana.tabs`); on load the note in the URL becomes the active tab.
- **Gone notes.** A tab whose note was deleted, moved to the trash or
  left in a space the account lost greys its title, and closes with a
  message when picked. A renamed note's tab follows the tree.

## Split panes

On a desktop (1024px and up) the content area splits into two panes
side by side, each with its own tab strip. Open to the right, on a note's
menu in the tree, a wikilink's right-click menu or a tab's menu, opens
the note in a second pane; `Mod+Alt`-click on a tree row, a search hit or
a wikilink does the same. There are two panes at most: with two, the
note takes the place of the active tab in the pane that is not focused.

- **Focus.** The focused pane has a line along the top of its strip. It
  is the one the keys act on, the one a click in the tree opens into, and
  the one the URL follows. A click anywhere in a pane focuses it;
  `Alt+\` swaps focus to the other one, the caret back where it was,
  and `Mod+Alt+Left` and `Mod+Alt+Right` pick a side.
- **The divider** drags, keeps each pane at least 360px wide, snaps to
  halves within 40px of the middle, and goes back to halves on a
  double-click.
- **Moving tabs.** A tab drags from one strip to the other. Dropping a
  tab on the right edge of the content area when there is one pane makes
  the second pane with it. Move to the other pane on the tab menu does it
  from the keyboard.
- **Closing.** Closing the last tab in a pane closes the pane, and the
  other takes the full width. `Mod+\` opens the current note to the right
  (in the other mode: read beside edit), or closes the right pane.
- **The same note twice.** Both panes can show one note, read on one
  side and edit on the other. They share one realtime session and one
  document, so each sees the other's keystrokes as they land; closing
  one leaves the other as it was. At most two note sessions are open,
  one per pane; background tabs stay records.
- **Narrow windows.** Below 1024px the right pane's tabs join the left
  strip and the split closes; widening does not split it again. Tablets
  and phones never split. The panes, which one is focused and the
  divider position are kept per browser with the tabs.

## Settings

`/settings` — from the account menu, the palette, or the sidebar — is a
column of sections beside the page on a desktop and a list that opens
one section at a time on a phone:

- **Account** — the display name shown beside your cursor (and, on a
  server without accounts, the author of your edits), a password change,
  and every device signed in with sign-out for one or all others.
- **People** (owner only) — the accounts: add, remove, reset a password.
- **Spaces and sharing** — create, rename and remove spaces; each space's
  members and roles for its owners, your own role otherwise; the space
  new notes and the daily note go into, and where the new-note picker
  starts.
- **Agents** (owner only) — keys for the MCP endpoint, with the URL and
  a copy button. See [agents.md](agents.md).
- **Appearance** — the preferences above.
- **Data** — exports, the trash and its retention, git history with
  Snapshot now, and the index: state, last scan, counts, ripgrep
  availability and version, the server version.

A page an account cannot use says what it is for and who can. A viewer
in a space sees its notes without the pencil, the title edit or the
delete action; the toolbar shows a Viewer badge instead.

## New note

New — the button in the top bar, `Alt+T`, New on the phone's bottom bar,
New note on the home screen and in the palette — opens the new-note
picker: the place and the name are chosen before the note is made. The
input starts as the folder the note would land in (beside the open note,
else the top of the default space) with a trailing slash. Type a name
after it and press Enter: `<folder>/<name>.md` is made with the name as
its heading and opens in a new tab in the editor, caret in the body. A
name ending in `.html` makes an HTML note. Folders in the path that are
not there yet are made; the line under the input says what Enter does,
"Creates personal/Daily/newnote.md", with a "new folder" tag for each
folder it will make. A first segment that is not a space resolves inside
the current space, as the Move picker does, and a folder that is there
keeps its spelling whatever the case typed.

Enter straight away, with the input still ending in a slash, is the old
New: `Untitled.md` (then `Untitled 2.md`, and so on) in that folder,
opened with the title selected. Type the title and press Enter: the
heading is written, the file is renamed to match, and the caret lands in
the body. A note left untitled stays `Untitled.md`, which is what it is.
The `+` on a space or folder in the tree and "New note here" skip the
picker and do exactly that, since the place is already chosen.

The picker completes like a shell. The arrow keys move over the folders
under what is typed; `Tab` writes the highlighted one into the input
with a trailing slash (`personal/`, then `personal/Daily/`) and the list
shows its children. `Shift+Tab`, or `Backspace` right after a slash,
goes up a level. Matching is fuzzy per segment, so `pe/da` then `Tab`
lands on `personal/Daily/`; folders elsewhere in the tree that fit the
name typed are listed below the ones in the folder. Space names complete
like folders.

When the path is a note that already exists (with or without the
extension, in any case) the first row is "Open <title>", and Enter opens
it in a tab; nothing is made. `Mod+Enter` makes a new one anyway, with
the next free name (`Plan 2`). Notes in the folder with names close to
the one typed are listed under it; Enter on one opens it.

Where the note opens: `Enter` in a new tab in the focused pane;
`Alt+Enter` in the other pane on a desktop (making the split when there
is one pane), in a new tab elsewhere; `Shift+Enter` in a tab behind the
current one, leaving the picker open at the same folder for the next
note. The keys are on a line at the bottom of the picker. On a phone the
picker has no Tab key to lean on: tapping a folder goes into it, an "Up
to" row goes back, and Enter on the keyboard or the Create button makes
the note.

The picker remembers places on each device. The last eight folders a
note was made in or opened from (`yana.folders.recent` in
`localStorage`, newest first, each once) sit at the top under "Recent"
while the input is untouched, with the tree below; typing matches both.
A recent folder that is renamed or moved follows it, one that is deleted
drops out. With no note open — the home screen, a page tab, an empty
pane — the picker starts in the folder a note was last made in
(`yana.folders.last`) rather than the top of the default space. Settings
→ Spaces → "New notes start" picks between "beside the open note, else
the last folder" (the default) and "always in the last folder". The Move
picker shows the same recent folders at the top.

In a folder whose notes follow a pattern, the picker suggests the next
name as grey text after the caret, while nothing is typed after the
folder. When at least half the notes in the folder are named by date
(`2026-09-22`), the suggestion is today's date; when the notes end in a
number that counts up under one name (`Standup 11`, `Standup 12`), it is
the next number (`Standup 13`), zero padding kept. Anything else
suggests nothing. `Right` at the end of the input, or `End`, takes the
suggestion (a tap on it does the same); `Tab` still completes folders,
typing anything else replaces it, and `Enter` with the suggestion
showing still makes an untitled note. Settings → Appearance → "Suggest
names for new notes" turns it off (`yana.newnote.suggest`).

The title is also where the note goes. A slash in it places the note:
`projects/kiln` moves it into `projects/` beside where it was (the folder
is made if it is not there) and calls it kiln; `/work/plan` starts from
the root, so it can change space; `../kiln` steps up a folder; `archive/`
with nothing after the slash moves the note and keeps its name. While
you type, a line under the title says where the note will land and
marks a folder that does not exist yet. The heading in the body only
ever gets the name, never the path.

The crumbs above the title are a button: the folder the note is in, and
a click opens "Move to a folder". The input holds the note's current
folder path, to edit by hand or leave alone; under it is every folder,
indented as in the tree, with the current one marked. Pick one with the
arrows, a click or a tap, or edit the path: the list narrows to the
folders under what is typed, and a path that is not there yet is made on
Enter. A bare name like `archive` lands inside the note's own space;
`work/archive` names the space. The same picker moves folders. The path
in the Details panel is a button too, for "Rename or move by path", the
same move with the file name included. On a desktop a note also drags to
a folder in the tree.

The quick switcher still creates the note you typed when nothing
matches.

## Capture

Capture — the button on the home page, in the phone's bottom bar and the
top bar elsewhere, `Alt+C`, or the palette — takes one line and appends
it to the end of today's daily note without opening it. The line lands
as `- text` through the note's CRDT document (`POST /api/notes/daily`
for the note, then a short realtime session to write the line), so a
client with the note open sees it arrive. The toast that follows has
Undo, which takes the line out again wherever it now sits. Offline, the
line queues in the outbox and lands when the connection returns. The
share target ([pwa.md](pwa.md)) uses the same code path.

## Tags

A `#tag` in a note body is a tag: letters, digits, `_`, `/` and `-`,
after a space, a `(` or the start of a line, not a plain number, not in
code. The renderer marks each one (`<span class="tag" data-tag="…">`)
and the client makes it a link to the tag's page; the note's tags also
sit as chips under the title. `/tags` lists every tag with a count
across the spaces you can see (`GET /api/tags`); `/tags/<tag>` lists
every note carrying one (`GET /api/tags/{tag}`). The quick switcher
matches on tags too: type `#kiln` and the notes tagged kiln come up.
Tags are not folders and do not move anything; a note's folder is where
its file is.

## Tree actions

Every row in the tree has actions: right-click, or the `⋯` that shows on
hover, on a desktop; hold the row on a phone, which opens a sheet with
the row's name and path at the top. A note has Open, Pin, Move to a
folder, Rename or move by path, and Delete. A folder has New note here,
New folder inside, Pin, Rename, Move to a folder, and Delete. A space
heading has New note here and New folder, and carries both as buttons.

New folder and Rename happen in the tree: an input row where the folder
is, or the folder's own name turned into one. Enter keeps it, Escape
drops it, and a click elsewhere keeps it too. A double-click on a folder
renames it; a double-click on a note opens it with the title selected,
which is how a note is renamed from the tree. On a phone, where there is
no double-click and the sidebar is a drawer, the same actions ask in a
prompt instead.

Folders are real directories, so the actions are file operations:

- **New folder** is `POST /api/dirs` `{path}`, a `mkdir`. The tree lists
  empty directories, so the folder is there at once, with "New note
  here" under it.
- **Rename** and **Move** go through `POST /api/dirs/move` `{path, to}`,
  which moves every note under the folder through the same reconciler
  path a single note takes (`docs/links.md`), so every inbound wikilink
  is rewritten; then whatever else the directory held — `_assets/`, files
  the scanner ignores — follows, and the empty shell is removed. The
  toast reports how many notes moved and how many links were rewritten.
  A folder can also be dragged onto another folder or a space heading.
- **Delete** is `DELETE /api/dirs?path=…`: every note under the folder
  goes to the trash the way a single delete does, and the directories
  left empty are removed. Assets stay (a restored note may need them),
  so a folder holding some keeps its shell.

## Search on a phone

On a phone, Search in the bottom bar (or `/`) opens a page of its own:
the box at the top with the keyboard up, the operator list and the
queries typed before it underneath until something is typed, results
after that. Recent queries are kept per browser (`yana.queries`, the
last eight). A result opens the note in read mode with the matched text
scrolled into view and marked; the mark stays while reading and clears
on entering the editor. Wider screens keep search in the sidebar and
open results the same way.

## Search operators

The search box takes plain full text (titles and bodies, and the text
inside PDFs), and a small set of operators that turn it into a tool. A
term is an operator when it starts with one of these names and a colon;
anything else is searched as text — an unknown operator like `foo:bar`
is searched, never rejected. A `-` in front of a term excludes it, and
double quotes make an exact phrase.

| Term | What it matches |
|---|---|
| `tag:home` (or `#home`) | notes carrying that tag |
| `path:folder/` | notes under a folder (or at a path, without the extension) |
| `space:work` | one space |
| `is:untagged` | notes with no tags |
| `is:task` | notes with an open task |
| `is:html` | HTML notes |
| `has:image` | notes that reference an image in `_assets/` |
| `has:attachment` | notes that reference any file in `_assets/` |
| `author:claude` | notes whose last edit was made by that person or agent |
| `before:2026-01-01` | modified before a day |
| `after:2026-01-01` | modified since a day |
| `-tag:done` | the minus excludes what follows |
| `"water heater"` | the words together, in order |

Operators combine with text and with each other:
`tag:home -tag:done "water heater" after:2026-01-01` is every note
tagged home, not tagged done, containing that phrase, modified since
that day. A query of operators alone (`is:untagged path:home/`) lists
what survives the filters, newest edit first. A date that is not
`YYYY-MM-DD` is searched as text.

The grammar is parsed in one place on the client
(`web/src/opsearch.ts`) and one on the server (`internal/search/
query.go`) with the same rules; the server maps the terms onto the
index as SQL filters around the full-text match
(`GET /api/search?q=…`). While typing, the search box and the switcher
highlight recognised operators as chips and offer completions after
`tag:`, `path:`, `space:`, `is:` and `has:` — the tags, folders and
spaces that exist. The switcher applies the operators the tree can
answer (`tag:`, `path:`, `space:`, `is:untagged`, `is:html`); the rest
belong to the search box. The regex search (`.* `, `GET
/api/search/regex?raw=…`) accepts only `path:` and `space:`, which
narrow where the pattern runs; everything else in the box is the
pattern.

A query worth keeping is saved under a name (Save this search, beside
the results) and pinned to the sidebar under the search box. Saved
searches are a preference of the browser like pins
(`yana.searches.saved` in `localStorage`), never files in the tree.

## Title

The heading at the top of a note is its title and is edited in place.
Committing a new title (Enter, or clicking away) rewrites the note's first
`# ` heading through the CRDT — so it reaches every open client like any
other edit — and renames the file to match, dropping only the characters
a path cannot hold. The rename goes through `POST /api/notes/{id}/move`,
so wikilinks follow. A note whose title comes from its file name (no
heading) is only renamed. Escape puts the old title back.

Path, dates and size live in the Details drawer beside the note, with the
backlinks and the history; the tags sit under the title.

## Read, edit, split

A note opens in read mode: the rendered document, the same HTML the
server produces everywhere else. Wikilinks open the note they point at
(or offer to create it), images load from `_assets/`, footnotes jump.
Task boxes are live: ticking one rewrites its `[ ]` or `[x]` through the
CRDT, so the change shows on every open client and reaches the file on
the next writeback, like any other edit. The renderer stamps each box
with the source line its marker sits on (`data-line`, counted from the
start of the body after any frontmatter); the client checks that line
still holds a marker in the expected state before writing, and re-renders
instead if the text has moved underneath.

Edit is the source editor. Get there with the pencil, by pressing `e`, or
on a desktop by clicking the body of the note anywhere that is not a link
or a box (a drag to select text does not count). Escape, or Done on a
phone, goes back to reading. Split shows the editor and the render side
by side and is for screens 720px and wider; `Mod+E` toggles it.

The mode a note opens in — read, edit, or split — is a preference in the
account menu, the palette and settings. A note you just created always opens in
the editor with the caret ready. A phone never opens in split; it reads.

Presence chips in the toolbar list the other people who have the note
open, one chip per person, in any mode. Your own account in another tab
is not listed.

### On a phone

While editing, a bar of formatting buttons sits above the keyboard:
bold, italic, heading (cycles `#`, `##`, `###`, none), list, task,
quote, code (inline, or a fence around a multi-line selection), link,
Attach, undo and redo. Attach opens the photo picker, the camera, or the
file browser, and uploads through the same `_assets/` path as drag and
drop. The buttons take no focus, so the keyboard stays up.

The shell sizes itself to the visual viewport while the keyboard is
open, so the caret and the bar stay above it. Lines wrap, long words
break, and nothing scrolls sideways; tables and code blocks scroll
inside themselves in the render. Autocorrect is off in the editor on a
phone (it rewrites paths, code and link targets); spellcheck and
sentence capitalisation stay on.

### Hide the syntax

An optional switch, off by default, collapses markdown marks on the
lines the caret is not on: `#` before headings, `**` and `_` around
emphasis, backticks around inline code, `~~`, and the brackets and
target of an inline link, so `[text](url)` reads as `text`. Move the
caret onto a line and its marks come back. Block marks (list bullets,
quotes, fences) and wikilinks are always shown. It is in the account
menu as "Hide syntax while editing".

## Conflicts

Two writes can meet the same path: a restore onto a path a newer note
holds, or an HTML save onto a file that changed underneath it. Neither
overwrites anything — the older write is parked beside the winner as
`name.conflict-<timestamp>.ext` — and the app shows those copies
instead of leaving them to pile up unseen:

- The note that survived carries a chip on its title bar: "1 conflict".
- In the sidebar tree the copy sits indented under its note, marked,
  rather than interleaved among the siblings.
- The Data page in settings lists every conflict in your spaces with
  its age and size.
- A copy whose original is gone is a plain note with a line under its
  title saying so.

The chip opens the resolution: a diff of the two bodies — the same
unified view the history panel shows — and three ways out. Keep mine
moves the copy to the trash, never deletes it. Keep theirs writes the
copy's text into the note as an edit, so open clients converge on it,
and moves the copy to the trash. Keep both renames the copy to
`name (older).ext`, an ordinary note. Each resolution is one commit in
the history under your name.

While any conflict exists, the home screen says how many. When a copy
appears for a note you have open, a toast says so.

## Editing

Each note's text is a Yjs document bound to the editor through
`y-codemirror.next`. Keystrokes become CRDT updates, batched on a 50 ms
timer and sent over the relay (`docs/realtime.md`); updates from other
clients and from the filesystem arrive the same way and splice into the
editor without touching the local caret.

Undo is scoped to the local client. The undo manager tracks only
transactions whose origin is the local binding; remote updates carry the
origin `remote` and are never on the stack. Undo in one tab does not revert
text typed in another, which the Phase 0 harness verified for the library
and the browser smoke test verifies for the app.

Presence comes from the awareness protocol: each client announces its
user (name, colour) and the editor binding publishes its cursor as a
relative position. Remote carets draw in the editor with the author's name;
the bar above the note lists who else is on it.

### Buttons and completion

The same formatting buttons the phone shows above its keyboard sit in
the toolbar on a desktop while editing (undo and redo are left to the
keyboard there): bold, italic, heading, list, task, quote, code, link,
Attach, tag. Each is a small command on the editor: wrap the selection,
toggle a line prefix, insert a mark. **Link** turns selected words into
`[[words]]`, a selected URL into `[](url)`, and with nothing selected
opens `[[` and the note list. **Tag** inserts `#` and the tags in use.

Typing `[[` offers the notes of the note's space (a link resolves inside
its space); picking one inserts its file name, or its path from the space
root when two notes share a file name, and closes the brackets. Typing
`#` at the start of a word offers the tags already in use. Escape closes
the list without leaving the editor; Mod-Space opens it by hand.

### The starter note

The owner's first sign-in seeds an empty tree with `Start here.md`, `A
linked note.md` and `_assets/yana.png`: ordinary files that show links
(one resolved, one not), a picture, tasks, tags, a table and a footnote
by using them, with a heading per feature saying how on a desktop and on
a phone. A tree that already holds a note is never seeded. Help lists
"how do I" entries that open the note at the matching heading, and
re-creates it in the default space when it is gone (`POST /api/guide`).

## Rendering

The read view and the split preview render the live document through
`POST /api/render` with the same goldmark pipeline the note endpoint
uses, so wikilinks, tags, code blocks, and images look the same
everywhere. The render that came with the note is shown first; the live
one replaces it once the session is up. Rendering runs at most every
220 ms while typing.

Three constructs go past plain markdown. The server marks each in the
HTML; the browser draws it, with a bundled copy of the library (no CDN,
so they work offline and in the exports).

**Diagrams.** A fence with the language `mermaid` renders as a diagram
(`internal/render/rich.go` emits it as `<pre class="mermaid">`; the
client swaps in the SVG). The diagram takes its colours from the app
theme, light or dark. One that fails to parse shows its source with a
one-line message.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Router --> Switch --> NAS
```

**Callouts.** A blockquote whose first line is `[!kind]` renders as a
callout with an icon and a colour. The kinds are `note`, `tip`,
`warning`, `danger`, `info` and `question`; anything else is a plain
callout titled with the kind. Text after the kind is the title. A `-`
or `+` right after the closing bracket makes the callout foldable,
folded or open.

```md
> [!warning] Mind the gap
> The body is ordinary markdown.
```

**Math.** `$…$` inline and `$$…$$` on lines of their own render with
KaTeX. A dollar sign that is not math stays a dollar sign: inline math
must close on the same line, may not have whitespace directly inside its
delimiters, may not run into a digit after the closing one, and may not
cross a backtick. `$5 and $10`, `$HOME` and `` `$x$` `` are left alone.

```md
The area is $\pi r^2$.

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$
```

The libraries are split from the main bundle and fetched the first time
a note needs one (`web/src/rich-load.ts`); the service worker precaches
them with the rest of `assets/`, so a diagram drawn once is drawn
offline too. The exports carry the same libraries as classic scripts
(`web/src/export-mermaid.ts`, `web/src/export-katex.ts`), copied beside
a static site's pages or inlined into a single-file export, fonts
included, only when a page uses them.

## Files: drag, drop, paste

Dropping a file onto the editor, pasting one from the clipboard, or picking
one from the Attach button (the phone's formatting bar, or the toolbar on a
desktop) uploads it to the note's sibling `_assets/` directory with `PUT
/api/files/<path>` and inserts `![alt](_assets/name.png)` at the drop point
for a picture, a plain `[name](_assets/name.ext)` link for anything else —
a PDF, a spreadsheet, a document. While the upload runs the document holds a
placeholder link, so other clients see something sensible; the server picks
a free name (`shot.png`, `shot-2.png`, …) rather than overwriting, and the
link uses the name it actually wrote. Uploads are bounded by
`YANA_MAX_ASSET_SIZE` and require write access to the space.

In the read view, a link into `_assets/` that is not a picture renders as a
card: name, size, and for a PDF its page count and a button that expands an
inline viewer on the content origin — sandboxed like an HTML note
([html-notes.md](html-notes.md)) — plus a download link. On a phone the
card opens the file in the system viewer instead. The scanner extracts a
PDF's text into search, so a phrase from inside a manual finds it; search
answers with attachments as their own kind alongside notes, each linking to
the note that uses the file and to the file itself. An asset no note
references shows up as unreferenced on the Data page, with a Trash button
that moves it to `.trash/` — never a delete.

Because an `<img>` cannot send an `Authorization` header, `GET
/api/files/...` also accepts the access token as `?token=`, the same way
`/ws` does.

Dragging a note from the sidebar tree onto a directory, a space heading, or
another note moves it there. That is a `mv` on disk through
`POST /api/notes/{id}/move`, so wikilinks pointing at the note are
rewritten (`docs/links.md`); the toast reports how many. Dragging a
folder does the same for everything in it (`POST /api/dirs/move`).
Dragging a note into the editor inserts a wikilink to it.

## Hotkeys

`Mod` is Command on a Mac and Control elsewhere. Browser-reserved
combinations (`Mod+N`, `Mod+T`) are avoided because pages cannot
intercept them. The tab keys use the usual `Mod+W`, `Mod+Shift+T` and
`Ctrl+Tab`, which a browser tab keeps for itself but the installed app
receives; each has an `Alt` twin that works everywhere.

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `Alt+T` | New note: the picker, to choose the folder and the name; Enter straight away makes an untitled note beside the open one with the title selected |
| `Alt+C` | Capture: one line onto the end of today's note, without opening it |
| `Alt+D` | Today's daily note (created on first use) |
| `Alt+K` | The tasks page |
| `Mod+P` | Quick switcher: fuzzy match on title, path and `#tag`; Enter on no match creates that note |
| `Mod+K` | Command palette: everything above plus new folder, pin, move, rename, delete, tags, unresolved links, trash, settings, theme, sign out |
| `Mod+Shift+F` or `/` | Focus search |
| `E` | Edit the open note |
| `Esc` | Back to reading |
| `Mod+E` | Editor and render side by side (on a phone: in and out of the editor) |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, or `Alt+]` / `Alt+[` | Next and previous tab, wrapping |
| `Alt+1` … `Alt+9`, or `Mod+1` … `Mod+9` | That tab; 9 is the last one |
| `Mod+W` or `Alt+W` | Close the active tab (a pinned one stays); with no tab open, the browser's own close |
| `Mod+Shift+T` or `Alt+Shift+T` | Reopen the tab closed last |
| `Mod+\` | Open the note to the right, or close the right pane (desktop) |
| `Alt+\` | Move focus to the other pane, the caret back where it was |
| `Mod+Alt+Left` / `Mod+Alt+Right` | Focus the left or right pane (the installed app; a browser tab keeps these for itself) |
| `Mod+Z` / `Mod+Shift+Z` | Undo / redo (local edits only) |
| `Mod+F` | Find in the open note |
| `Esc` | Close whatever is open |

The switcher and the palette list every note in the tree and filter as you
type; arrows move, Enter picks. The switcher puts recently opened notes
first. The full list of shortcuts is one palette entry, also in the
account menu.

## Daily note

`Alt+D` (or the palette) opens today's note. The client sends its local
date to `POST /api/notes/daily` with the space to use — the daily-note
space from settings, else the open note's space, else the default space
from settings, else the first one in the tree — and the server answers
with the existing note or creates it.

Two settings shape it, both paths relative to the space:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `YANA_DAILY_PATTERN` | `journal/{YYYY}/{MM}/{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}.md` | Where the note lives |
| `YANA_DAILY_TEMPLATE` | `templates/daily.md` | A note whose body seeds a new daily note |

`{YYYY}`, `{MM}`, `{DD}` and `{date}` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) expand in both. When
the template note does not exist the new note starts as a heading with the
date. The template's own frontmatter is dropped; the daily note gets an id
of its own like any other file.

## Endpoints added for the editor

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PUT /api/files/{path}` | Upload one file under an `_assets/` directory; body is the file, response carries the path written (and a PDF's page count once extracted) |
| `DELETE /api/files/{path}` | Move one asset to `.trash/` — never a delete |
| `GET /api/attachments/{path}` | One attachment's metadata: name, size, and a PDF's page count |
| `GET /api/assets/orphans` | Assets no note in their space references, for the Data page |
| `GET /api/notes/{id}/asset-view?asset=` | Mints the content-origin URL an attachment card's inline viewer loads |
| `POST /api/notes/daily` | `{space, date}` → today's note, created from the template if missing |
| `POST /api/guide` | `{space}` → the starter note in that space, written first when missing (`201`), found otherwise (`200`); editors and up |
| `POST /api/render` | `{markdown}` → `{html}` for the read view and the preview |
| `GET /api/tags` | Every tag with its note count, across the spaces the account can see |
| `GET /api/tags/{tag}` | Every note carrying one tag |
| `POST /api/dirs` | `{path}` → make an empty folder |
| `POST /api/dirs/move` | `{path, to}` → move every note under a folder (links rewritten), then the rest, then remove the shell |
| `DELETE /api/dirs?path=` | Trash every note under a folder and remove the directories left empty |
| `GET /api/conflicts` | Every conflict copy in the caller's spaces, with the note it belongs to |
| `GET /api/notes/{id}/conflicts` | The conflict copies behind one note, for its chip |
| `GET /api/conflicts/{id}/diff` | A unified diff between one copy and its survivor |
| `POST /api/conflicts/{id}/resolve` | `{action: mine, theirs, or both}` settles one copy |
| `GET /api/search/regex?raw=` | The regex search over the files; `path:` and `space:` terms in `raw` narrow where it runs |

`GET /api/tree` lists empty directories as well as the notes, each
note row carries its `tags`, and a conflict copy nests under the note
it belongs to (marked `conflict`, the survivor named in `conflict_of`).

`GET /api/status` now includes `daily` with the effective pattern and
template, and `conflicts` with how many copies wait in the caller's
spaces.

## Building

`web/` builds with esbuild (`npm run build`) into `web/dist`, which the
binary embeds. Bundle names carry a content hash (`assets/app-XXXX.js`)
and `index.html` is rewritten to match, so the long immutable cache
lifetime the server puts on `/assets/` is safe across releases. The same
build copies the icons from `web/icons/`, writes `manifest.webmanifest`, and
fills `sw.template.js` into `sw.js` with the hashed names and a version
stamp — the installable-app side of the client
([pwa.md](pwa.md)). `npm run watch` skips the worker so development is
never shadowed by a cache.
