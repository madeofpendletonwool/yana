// The CRDT engine: the AAR `make android-crdt` builds from mobile/crdt
// (Phase 12a) lands in libs/. This project publishes that file as its one
// artifact, so the app depends on `project(":crdt")` and gets the AAR's
// classes and native libraries as if it were a library module. (An
// Android library module cannot carry a local AAR; AGP refuses to bundle
// one.) The AAR is a build artifact, not committed: until it is built this
// project provides nothing, and nothing in the app calls into it before
// the editor (Phase 12e).
