# YANA/ for Android

The Android client: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3. It signs in to a
YANA/ server and browses its spaces, folders and notes, with an offline
replica (Room) that keeps the tree, note reading, and search working in
airplane mode. Navigation follows the web's phone layout — a bottom
bar (Notes, Search, Capture, Today, Tasks, New) over a home screen —
on a phone; on a tablet, a foldable opened flat, or a Chromebook the
shell goes two-pane instead (see [Large screens](#large-screens)). The
home screen holds
Today, pinned and recent notes, and a "what changed" line; the tree of
every space that reopens the way it was left; a quick switcher over
the replica; tags with their pages; and a details sheet on every note
with its backlinks. Markdown notes read rendered — headings, lists, code,
tables, callouts, mermaid diagrams, math, images, tappable wikilinks and
tags, and task boxes that tick — and edit live through the shared
document: a plain text field whose changes become document operations,
with undo scoped to this device and other people's cursors drawn in
their colors. HTML notes render in a sandboxed WebView and edit by
source. A Tasks page gathers every open box across a space (or every
space) grouped by the note it lives in, ticked in place, following
changes live while it is open and shown from the cache with its age when
the network is gone. History reads the same way it does on the web: a
note's revisions with their diffs and restores, the activity feed of
what changed by whom grouped by day, and a point-in-time restore
previewed before it runs — online only, because the history lives on
the server. Capture is the phone's whole point: the share target, two
quick-settings tiles, a home-screen widget, and Today and Capture on
the home screen all make their note in the replica first — a
client-minted ULID, an inbox path, an empty document ready to type in —
and sync carries it to the server later.

## Build

```sh
make android-crdt             # at the repo root: builds the CRDT AAR the app needs
make android-reader           # at the repo root: builds the reader WebView's assets
cd android
./gradlew build              # lint, unit tests, debug and release builds
./gradlew assembleDebug      # just the debug APK
./gradlew installDebug       # onto a running emulator or a connected phone
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest  # the WebView sandbox tests, on a device
```

The build makes one APK per ABI (`arm64-v8a` for phones, `x86_64` for
an Intel emulator, `armeabi-v7a` for old 32-bit phones); `installDebug`
picks the right one. The debug APKs land at
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-<abi>-debug.apk` and install beside a release build (`com.collinpendleton.yana.debug`). Debug builds
sign with the checked-in `app/debug.keystore`, so a CI build installs over
a local one and the other way round. CI
runs `make android-crdt` and `make android-reader` and then
`./gradlew build` on every pull request that touches `android/` and
attaches the debug APKs to the run as `yana-debug-apk`.

The CRDT AAR needs a JDK (17+), the Android SDK with the pinned NDK,
and Go; see [mobile/crdt/README.md](../mobile/crdt/README.md). Without
it the app does not compile — the realtime sync layer calls into it —
so build it first.

The reader assets (the reader page, its script, its stylesheet and the
KaTeX fonts under `app/src/main/assets/reader/`) are a build artifact
too: `make android-reader` runs the web toolchain over
`web/src/android-reader.*` and copies the output in. Without them the
gradle build fails with the instruction to run it.

The instrumented tests (`./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest`, emulator
or device attached) check the offline search against the fixture corpus
in `app/src/androidTest/assets/searchfixtures/`; see
[docs/android-offline-search.md](../docs/android-offline-search.md)
for how that corpus is generated and what parity it pins. The reader's
sandbox test (`ReaderSandboxTest`) proves a note's injected markup
cannot run in the reading view.

## Home and navigation

Getting around on the phone follows the web's phone layout. A bottom
bar carries the same six buttons the web's does: Notes (the tree; a
second tap walks back home), Search, Capture, Today, Tasks with the
open count as its badge, and New. Home is not one of them — the
wordmark and the back gesture are home, exactly the web's arrangement,
where the wordmark is home and the bar is not. The bar steps out of
the way while a note is being edited and on the screens that are not
its own (settings, history, the activity feed).

Home holds the "What changed" line (a tap opens the activity feed),
Today, Capture, Tasks, and Tags rows, then the pinned notes and the
recent ones, then the spaces. Pins are a preference of this device, as
on the web: pin and unpin from the note's menu, and the pinned section
lists them newest-pin-first.

The tree — the Notes tab, or a space from home — is every space the
account holds, each collapsible, its folders closed until they are
opened and its notes under them. The opened folders and the collapsed
spaces are remembered per device the moment they change, so a kill and
relaunch shows the same shape (the web's Phase 30 semantics: only
opened folders and closed spaces are stored, so an empty store is the
default state).

The tree organises, the web's Phase 17 actions on a phone: a plus on a
space or folder row makes an untitled note there, and a long press
opens the row's actions — a new note or a new folder inside, rename
and move with a folder picker, delete after a confirm that says the
notes go to the trash for thirty days. Making and moving a note work
offline: the move joins the `pending_ops` queue and the replica moves
with it, so airplane mode reads the change and the replay lands it,
the id unchanged. Folders and deletes are writes the server must see.

The New tab opens the new-note picker, the web's `newnote.tsx`: the
input holds a path — everything up to the last slash is the folder,
the rest is the name — and the list under it walks into folders and
back out, matching segments fuzzily. A name that names a note that is
there opens that note instead of making a second; an empty name makes
an untitled note in the folder and opens it ready to title. The
folders a note was made in or moved to on this device sit at the top
until something is typed, and the folder used last is where the picker
starts. The quick entries — the tile, the widget, the share target —
keep going straight to the editor in the capture space's inbox; only
the in-app New uses the picker.

The trash — Settings, Data, Trash — lists the deleted notes the server
can bring back (`GET /api/trash`) with restore, delete for good, and
emptying, both destructions behind a confirm. The deleted-notes list
below it covers what the history alone remembers; the trash's last row
leads there.

The switcher — the command mark in home's and the tree's title bar —
is a search-as-you-type list of every note over the replica, the web's
quick palette: an empty box lists recents first, typing fuzzy-matches
titles and paths (the web's `fuzzy.ts` ported line for line, tests
included), a `#word` narrows to the notes carrying the tag, and the
`tag:`/`path:`/`space:`/`is:` operators filter the rows the tree can
judge. A name nothing carries offers a Create row, which makes the
note in the capture space the way the web's switcher does.

Tags have their pages, the web's: the list with counts, one page per
tag with the notes carrying it in path order — from `GET /api/tags`
and `GET /api/tags/{tag}` online, from the replica when the network is
gone. A tag chip on a note opens its page.

A note's menu also holds its details: a sheet with the path, created
and modified times, size, tags, and Linked from — the backlinks over
`GET /api/notes/{id}/backlinks`, each row the linking note and the
line its link sits on — plus the way to the note's history.

## Large screens

A tablet, a foldable opened flat, or a Chromebook uses the width the
way the web does at tablet size. A compact width keeps the phone
layout with its bottom bar. A medium or expanded width goes
list-detail — the list screen on the left (the tree, search, tasks, a
tag page, home) and the note it picks on the right, opening notes
never leaving the two-pane layout — and the bottom bar steps out of
the way, as the web's does past its phone layout. The back arrow on
the note clears the right side back to its nothing-open rest state.

At an expanded width the note side itself splits, the web's split
pane: a note's menu carries *Open beside*, which sets the note beside
itself in the other mode — read beside edit — over a divider that
drags and double-taps back to the middle. Either side reads or edits,
a wikilink opens in the pane it was tapped from, and two panes on the
same note follow each other live through the shared document, so
edits on one side arrive on the other as they land.

A hardware keyboard carries the web's shortcuts on the keys an app
can take: Ctrl+P opens the switcher, Ctrl+T the new-note picker,
Ctrl+F search, E flips the note on screen between reading and
editing, and Escape finishes an editor, closes the open note, or goes
back. Settings → Help lists them.

State survives a rotation and a fold: the open note stays, the editor
keeps its caret and its scroll, and crossing the fold line hands the
note between the phone layout and the two-pane one without reloading
it — the list side never resets. The web's tabs are not ported: the
recents list and the switcher cover the same need on Android.

## The reading view

A markdown note reads the way it reads on the web: the same goldmark
engine the server renders with runs on the device through the bind
package (`Crdt.renderMarkdown`), and the reader page — an APK asset
built from the web's own sources (`web/src/android-reader.*`: the
rich.ts runtime with mermaid and KaTeX bundled, the app.css tokens and
markdown styles) — draws it in a WebView over `WebViewAssetLoader`:
no network from the page, scripts only from the app's assets, file
access off, and no bridge back to the app. Taps (a wikilink, a dashed
link, a tag, a task box) leave as `yana://` navigations the
`WebViewClient` answers; external links go to the system browser.
Wikilinks resolve from the note payload when online, or against the
replica with the server's own resolution rules when not; a dashed link
creates the note at the path the web would (offline, through the
`pending_ops` queue). Task boxes tick through `PATCH /api/tasks`; a
tick offline queues as a pending op and the box reads back ticked.
`_assets/` images load through the app's fetcher with the auth header
and a disk cache, so the token never enters the page.

 `![[note]]` embeds arrive already inlined in the server's render, so
 the reader shows them as it shows any note body; an embed the server
 could not resolve falls back to a wikilink span and is wired like one.

## The tasks page

Every open `- [ ]` across a space — or across every space the account
belongs to — grouped by the note it lives in, over `GET /api/tasks`.
Filters pick a space, a folder, a tag, and a toggle for tasks completed
in the last 30 days. A row opens its note scrolled to the task's line;
the line's markdown shows styled (bold, italics, code, strikethrough)
the way the note renders it.

Ticking calls `PATCH /api/tasks` with the note id and the body line,
exactly the write the web's tasks page and the in-note checkbox use, so
everyone's list agrees. A tick the server cannot take (the line moved
under it, a viewer's space) reverts with the server's reason; a 409
refetches the listing, which is how the server says the list catches up
on its own. Offline, the tick queues in `pending_ops`, flips the cached
note and the cached listing so it reads back ticked, and replays on
reconnect — the replay of an already-applied tick writes nothing, so
there is no duplicate edit.

While the screen is open the sync engine watches the listed spaces over
its socket (the same `watch`/`chg` frames the web's page uses) and the
listing refetches, debounced, as changes land. The last fetched list is
cached in Room per filter and shows with its age when the network is
gone. The open count feeds the home screen's Tasks row.

## History and activity

The history layer is the git repository under the notes root, the same
one the web reads: online only, because that is where it lives. A
note's History (the clock in its title bar, or the History row in its
details sheet) lists its revisions over
`GET /api/notes/{id}/history` with who made each — a person, an agent,
or the files — and when. A revision opens its diff
(`GET /api/notes/{id}/history/diff`) as a wrapped, tinted list at phone
width: additions green, removals in the error color, hunks headed;
an older revision diffs against the newest so the diff says what
changed since it stood, the newest against the one before it.
Restore confirms, then writes the old text back as a live edit over
`POST /api/notes/{id}/history/restore` — the open editor converges on
the restored text and the history shows who restored it, the same
revertible edit the web's panel makes.

The activity feed ("What changed", from home or a space's title bar)
reads `GET /api/spaces/{space}/activity` for one space or for every
space the account belongs to, merged by time and grouped by day. An
agent's run of commits is one entry with its span; the notes an entry
touched open at a tap (a deleted note carries its path, untappable).
Opening the feed marks it seen — kept on this device the way the web
keeps it per browser — and the "Since I last looked" window plus the
divider under what is new follow from that marker; the home screen's
What changed row counts what landed since without marking anything.

An entry's restore icon (only where the server would take one: the
space's feed says for that scope, and the tree is the owner's move)
opens a preview over `POST /api/git/restore/preview` that lists every
note that comes back, changes, moves, or goes — the same list the
web's preview shows for the same point — and the confirm runs
`POST /api/git/restore`. What stands now is committed and tagged
first, and what the restore removes goes to the trash, so it comes
back the same way.

Deleted notes (Settings → Data) list over `GET /api/deleted-notes`
with what a restore recovers each from — the trash copy, the retained
edits, or the history — and restoring one brings it back to where it
lived, or a free name beside whatever took its path, opening the note
when it lands. With history off (a build without the git layer) these
screens say so instead of guessing.

Conflict copies — the `name.conflict-<ts>` files the server parks when
two writes meet one path — surface and settle the way the web does. A
note with copies waiting carries a banner above its body
(`conflict_count` on the note, `GET /api/notes/{id}/conflicts` behind
it), Settings → Data lists every copy in the account's spaces with the
count in its row (`GET /api/conflicts`), and both doors open the same
resolve screen: the copy's diff against its survivor
(`GET /api/conflicts/{id}/diff`) as the same wrapped, tinted list the
history screen shows, and the web's three choices over
`POST /api/conflicts/{id}/resolve` — keep this note (the copy moves to
the trash), keep the copy (its text becomes this note), keep both (the
copy is renamed to an ordinary note). Each choice confirms with its
consequence first, lands as one commit, and the screen closes itself
when nothing waits. An HTML save that parks a copy says so beside the
source editor with a Resolve button into the same screen. A copy whose
original is gone is a plain note; the list opens it instead of
resolving it. The tree keeps copies out of its rows entirely (they
nest under their survivor server-side), and search treats them as the
real notes they are, the same as the web.

## Capture

Getting a thought in is the point of the app on a phone, so every fast
entry point makes its note in the replica first and lets sync carry it
to the server later. A note composed offline is born with a ULID this
device mints, lands in the replica with an empty document that is ready
to type into immediately, and a create op joins `pending_ops` carrying
the id in the content's frontmatter — the server's `EnsureID` keeps an
id that is already there, so the note arrives everywhere with the ULID
it was born with. The create replays empty on purpose: the server seeds
a note's document from its file on first sight, so a create that
arrived with text would meet the same text authored again by the
editor's document, doubled. Everything the person wrote rides the
document's own outbox instead, and converges.

The entry points:

- **Home: Today and Capture.** Today opens or makes the daily note —
  online over `POST /api/notes/daily` (so the server's template seeds
  it), offline at the path the cached daily pattern names
  (`GET /api/status` carries the pattern; the server's default stands
  in until it has answered). Capture takes one line onto the end of
  today's note without opening it, as `- text`, the web's capture.
- **The share target** (`ACTION_SEND`, text, URLs, and photos): a light
  activity shows what arrived with two ways in — a new note in the inbox folder,
  or the block appended to a note picked from the recent list with
  search over the replica. Photos (`ACTION_SEND` or
  `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE` with images) upload to `_assets/` through the
  same path as the editor's image action before the note is written.
  A new note opens the editor inside the share
  activity, so backing out returns to the app that shared; an append
  confirms and returns on its own.
- **The APPEND intent** (`com.collinpendleton.yana.APPEND`, exported):
  appends a timestamped line (`- HH:mm text`) to a note by id — the
  share target's append, exposed for automation apps. Extras:
  `com.collinpendleton.yana.extra.NOTE_ID` and `.TEXT`.
- **Two quick-settings tiles**: one makes an inbox note and opens the
  editor on it; the other opens the one-line capture. Both show over
  the lock screen — the note and its edits live in the replica, and the
  network parts wait for the unlock.
- **The home-screen widget** (Glance): a New note tap target and the
  last three notes, each a tap from open.
- **Long-press shortcuts** on the launcher icon: new note, capture,
  today.

Appends go through the note's CRDT document — the same path the web's
share target uses — so they merge with open editors and land on every
device. Offline, an append needs the note as a local document (opened
once before), exactly the web client's rule; Today and Capture make
their note locally when it is missing, so they never fail for that.

Settings holds the two knobs: the space Today, Capture, and the tiles
work in (the first space by default), and the inbox folder under each
space (`inbox` by default). The daily-note pattern is read from the
server and cached, never edited here — it is the server's setting.

Debug builds log each entry point's cost: intent receipt to the first
editable frame (`adb logcat -s CapturePerf`).

## Settings

Settings covers what a phone does well and hands the rest to the web
by link. Account holds the password — changing it signs every other
device out; this one stays — and every device signed in with its
label, each revocable (`GET /api/auth/sessions`,
`DELETE /api/auth/sessions/{id}`): the device a revoke ends signs out
on its next request, this one included. Spaces and sharing lists each
space with the role this account holds in it, makes new ones, and for
a space's owner renames the label and adds, changes, or removes
members (`PATCH /api/spaces/{space}` writes the label and the whole
member list at once, the one write the server takes), picking from the
server's accounts by name when the server's owner does it. People (the
server's owner only) lists the accounts, adds one with a starting
password, resets one, or removes it (`/api/users`). Data holds the
trash, the deleted-notes and conflicts lists, and exports a space as a
zip (`GET /api/spaces/{space}/export/notes.zip`, downloaded with the
session's auth) through the share sheet. Help opens the Start here
note, asking the
server to make it (`POST /api/guide`) when it is not there yet. Agents
and backups (the owner's), site export, and space conventions stay on
the web: their rows open the signed-in server at its `/settings/`
section.

Put the SDK location in `android/local.properties`
(`sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk`) or set `ANDROID_HOME`. Android Studio
writes the file itself.| Piece | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| JDK | 17 | What AGP 9 needs; the same JDK the CRDT AAR builds with |
| Gradle | 9.8.0 (wrapper, checksum pinned) | |
| Android Gradle Plugin | 9.4.1 | Compiles Kotlin itself, so there is no separate Kotlin Android plugin |
| Kotlin | 2.4.20 (Compose and serialization compiler plugins) | |
| `compileSdk` | 37 | Current AndroidX and OkHttp releases require it to compile against |
| `targetSdk` | 36 (Android 16) | The newest release the app has been run against; it moves up after a run on the next release's behaviour changes |
| `minSdk` | 26 (Android 8.0) | Adaptive icons and `java.time` without desugaring, the Keystore features `EncryptedSharedPreferences` relies on, and about 97% of active devices. The CRDT AAR's floor is 24, so it does not constrain this |
| Room | 2.8.5 (runtime + KSP compiler) | The offline replica |
| Bundled SQLite | 2.7.1 (`androidx.sqlite:sqlite-bundled`) | The same SQLite build on every device, which is what carries the FTS5 trigram tokenizer the replica's search index is declared with below the API levels that ship it |
| WorkManager | 2.12.0 | The periodic replica sync |

## Point it at a local server

Run `yana` on your computer, then enter its address on the first
screen:

- **Emulator:** `http://10.0.2.2:8080`. The emulator reaches the host's
  loopback at 10.0.2.2, so a server on `127.0.0.1` is enough.
- **Phone on the same network:** `http://<your computer's LAN IP>:8080`.
  The server must listen on every interface (the default `:8080` does;
  `YANA_LISTEN=127.0.0.1:8080` does not).

A bare host name becomes `https://`. Plain HTTP works because a home
server often has no certificate; the app says when an address uses it.
User-installed CA certificates are trusted, so a server behind a private
CA works once its root is installed on the phone.

A fresh server with no accounts shows the first-run form, which creates
the owner, the same as the web's first visit.

## Sign-in and sessions

Sign-in sends the password once and gets back an access token (15
minutes) and a refresh token (30 days of inactivity). Both, with the
server address and the account, live in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`
under an AES-256 Keystore key, and are left out of backups: the key does
not travel, so a restored copy could not be opened anyway.

Every request carries the access token. One that is about to lapse is
swapped for a new one before the request goes out; a request refused
with `401` trades the refresh token once and retries. The app keeps its
session across restarts without asking for the password again.

The session is labeled with the device (`android · Pixel 8`), so it
appears by name in the session list on the web's Account page. Revoking
it there signs the phone out on its next request: the refresh is
refused, the stored tokens are cleared, and the app returns to sign-in
saying the device was signed out. Sign out in the app's settings revokes
the session on the server first, then forgets it locally, even when the
server cannot be reached.

## The REST client

Retrofit over OkHttp, with kotlinx.serialization for JSON. The token
lifecycle sits in one OkHttp interceptor and one `Authenticator`
(`data/TokenAuth.kt`), which is the whole of silent refresh. The same
OkHttp client carries the realtime WebSocket in the sync phase, so
there is one HTTP stack, one connection pool and one TLS configuration.
Ktor would need an engine plus its auth and content-negotiation plugins
for the same result.

## The offline replica

A Room database (`data/replica/`) mirrors the server's cache tables —
spaces, notes, tags, note bodies — plus the flattened folder tree and a
`pending_ops` queue for offline create/append/move actions. Metadata
syncs on launch, on pull-to-refresh, and from a six-hourly WorkManager
job; a note's text is cached when it is opened. The replica belongs to
the signed-in account: a different account or server wipes it, and so
does signing out.

Search runs against an FTS5 trigram index declared with the server's
own DDL, and the query grammar and SQL are line-for-line ports of the
server's, so the same query over the same notes returns the same
ordered results offline and online. The divergences (author:, is:task,
has: are server-only) are recorded in
[docs/android-offline-search.md](../docs/android-offline-search.md).

Screens never touch Room or REST directly: they go through
`NoteRepository` (`data/NoteRepository.kt`), which answers from the
server when it can be reached and from the replica when it cannot. The
editor and capture features join the shell there.

## Realtime sync

Markdown notes are CRDT documents, the same ones the web edits: one
WebSocket per app speaks the relay protocol in
[docs/realtime.md](../docs/realtime.md) — binary msgpack frames, a
`sub` with the device's state vector, the missing delta back as
`subd`, then streamed `upd` frames — with the same 50ms keystroke
batching and the same reconnect backoff (500ms doubling to 8s, with
jitter) the web client uses. The wire codec lives in `data/rt/Wire.kt`
and its tests pin the bytes against frames the server's own encoder
produced.

Each note's document is one Room blob (`note_crdt.state`, the
compaction of everything applied or authored here) plus an outbox
(`crdt_outbox`) of encoded updates the server has not confirmed.
Confirmation is the application `ping`/`pong`: the server reads frames
in order, so a pong proves it applied every update sent before the
ping, and rows leave the outbox then and only then. A dropped
connection, a dead process, or a day offline all leave the rows in
place; the next connection re-sends them and CRDT idempotence absorbs
the duplicates. A connection dot in the note's title bar says where
things stand — offline, syncing, or live — with no toasts.

## The markdown editor

Reading is the default. A markdown note opens rendered; Edit opens the
editor (`ui/editor/`) and Done returns to the reading view, each handoff
carrying the scroll across as a fraction of how far the pane could go —
the editor opens about where the reading was and the reader resumes
about where the editing left it. A new note opens straight in the editor
with the caret at the end, ready to type. The editor is a plain text
field bound to the document. Each change the field reports diffs to one
replacement — `doc.edit(pos, del, insert)` commits the delete and the
insert as one transaction, so a keystroke is one update, one undo step,
and one outbox row. Document changes from elsewhere — a peer's typing,
an undo, the initial sync — arrive on the `observeText` feed as the
text plus the change's replacement hunks, and the editor maps the
cursor through them instead of resetting it. Undo is scoped to this
device by the bind package's manager; a typing burst (keystrokes no
more than 700ms apart) undoes as one step, the buttons sit in the bar
above the keyboard with Ctrl-Z / Ctrl-Y for hardware keyboards, and a
formatting button never merges with the typing around it.

The formatting bar is the web's phone bar: bold, italic, heading, list,
task, quote, code, link, image, tag, undo, and redo, in that order
(`ui/editor/FormatCommands.kt` is a port of `web/src/format.tsx`, with
unit tests over the same selections). Each button commits its change as
one multi-region transaction — the bind package's `EditMany` applies
several replacement hunks in one go — so a button is one CRDT
operation, one undo step, and the same markdown the web's button
writes. Buttons take no focus, so the keyboard stays up and the caret
stays put. The image button is the photo picker and camera from
[Images](#images); the link and tag buttons open the completions.

Completion: typing `[[` offers the notes of the space in the
switcher's order (the same `Switcher.rows` the quick switcher lists —
recents first on an empty query, fuzzy titles and paths once letters
arrive); picking one finishes the link and leaves the caret inside the
brackets so `|` can start an alias, the way the web's popup does. `#`
offers the tags in use. A note links by its file name, and twins in
one space link by their path within it (`data/LinkTargets.kt`, the
web's rule).

The title in the app bar is editable: the heading in the document
follows as one edit, and the file moves to the path the title spells
(a slash places the note) with the server rewriting the links —
online now, or through the offline move queue when the network is
gone. The rules are the web's `paths.ts`, ported with tests
(`data/NotePaths.kt`).

"New from template" is not yet available; see
[docs/android.md](../docs/android.md).

Presence is the awareness protocol the web speaks: the local cursor
broadcasts as a JSON relative position on a 50ms throttle over the
relay's `aw` frames, and other people's cursors and selections draw
over the text in their colour with a name chip. The codec
(`data/rt/Awareness.kt`) is pinned by tests against bytes the web's own
libraries produced. Peers silent for thirty seconds are swept, and
leaving the editor withdraws the cursor.

Every offset is a UTF-16 code unit end to end — the text field's
selections, the document, and the wire agree — so emoji and combining
characters edit cleanly.

## Images

A note's photos live where the web keeps them: the `_assets/`
directory beside the note. The editor's image action (the picture in
its bottom bar) offers the photo picker (`PickVisualMedia`, no
storage permission) or the camera (`TakePicture` into the app's own
cache through a `FileProvider`); the photo uploads through the same
`PUT /api/files/<path>` the web editor uses, and the link
`![caption](_assets/name.jpg)` lands at the cursor as one document
operation. While the upload runs the document holds a placeholder
marker, which becomes the link when the server answers with the name
it wrote, or leaves with the reason when it refuses.

Names follow the web client exactly — the same sanitization, the same
stamped fallback a pasted screenshot gets (`photo-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`,
UTC to the second) — so both clients produce the same tree. A photo
longer than 2048 pixels on its longest edge is downscaled to it and
re-encoded as JPEG quality 90, rotated the way its EXIF says first so
a portrait photo stays portrait; anything inside the limit goes up
untouched. Offline, the link is written now and the upload joins the
`pending_ops` queue with its bytes staged beside the replica,
replaying on the next sync; a replay that lands under another name
(the one asked for was taken) fixes the note's link through the
document. Until an upload lands, the reading view shows a placeholder
naming the photo, and when the queue drains the body re-renders with
the real ones.

`_assets/` images render with the auth header and a disk cache —
OkHttp's, inside the reader's own `AssetFetcher`, which is the "or
equivalent" of the usual Coil choice: the reading view is a WebView
whose page never loads an image itself, so the fetcher that already
stands between it and the server is the right place, and the token
never enters the page.

The work happens three ways:

- The note screen opens a session and streams while it is on screen.
- Going to the background with unconfirmed edits enqueues an expedited
  WorkManager job that flushes the outbox without the app being open.
- A periodic job (every 30 minutes, network permitting) flushes
  anything left and pulls deltas for recently opened notes, updating
  the replica and its search index.

One platform caveat, recorded rather than hidden: after a literal
force stop, Android will not run any of the app's jobs until it is
opened again. The outbox is durable, so the edits survive and go out
on the next launch (or the next job the system allows); no app can do
more under a force stop.

Verifying the reconnect story by hand, against `yana` on your
computer:

```sh
# With the emulator signed in and a markdown note open:
adb shell am force-stop com.collinpendleton.yana.debug   # restarts cold, edits intact
# On the computer: stop the server mid-typing, watch the dot go
# offline, restart the server, watch the dot return to live and the
# note converge with what the web shows.
# Airplane mode for ten minutes with local edits, then back: both
# sides merge.
```

The JVM suite (`SyncEngineTest`) runs the same scenarios against
MockWebServer speaking the real frames, with a stand-in for the CRDT
engine the AAR provides.

## Attachments, PDFs, public links, and sending a note

Everything that is not an image rides the same rails. The editor's
image action also offers *Choose file* — the system document picker
(`OpenDocument`, no storage permission) — and the share target takes
`ACTION_SEND` of any MIME type: a file a picker or another app hands
over uploads as it is (no decode, no resize) to the note's sibling
`_assets/` through the same `PUT /api/files/<path>` the web editor
uses, under the web client's name for it, and lands at the cursor (or
in the shared block) as the plain link the web writes for a
non-image, `[name](_assets/name)`. The in-flight marker, the offline
queue with staged bytes, the name-collision fix through the document,
and the reader's placeholder while an upload waits are all the
image path's, shared.

In the reading view, an attachment's link opens by type:

- A **PDF** mints the note's `GET /api/notes/{id}/asset-view` URL and
  renders in a dialog holding the same sandboxed content-origin
  WebView an HTML note renders in — the same navigation restrictions,
  the minted URL the only credential, links off the content origin
  bound for the system browser. It never renders in the app's origin.
  The mint needs the server, so a PDF does not open offline.
- Anything else downloads with the session's auth into the cache and
  leaves for the system viewer (`ACTION_VIEW` through the
  `FileProvider`, the MIME type from the server or the file's
  extension); a device with nothing that opens the type says so.

Public links come from the note's menu: *Public link* makes the
note's live link (the web's expiry choices — 1 day, 1 week, never),
shows the address with Copy and the phone's share sheet, and revokes
it. While a link is live the note carries a small globe badge beside
its path, the phone's reading of the web's globe. A revoked link
stops working at once, everywhere.

*Send the note*, also from the menu, hands the note out two ways: the
markdown text through the share sheet, or the standalone HTML export
(`GET /api/notes/{id}/export.html`) as one self-contained file.

Search finds text inside attachments when the phone is online — the
server's index covers PDF text since Phase 22, and the app's search
asks the server first. Offline search does not cover attachment
text: the replica indexes note titles and the bodies this device has
opened, not the files beside them.

## HTML notes

HTML notes render in a WebView on the content origin, the server's
second listener, with the same boundary the web's iframe has:
JavaScript runs, but there is no bridge to the app, no file access, and
mixed content is blocked. The signed view URL is the only credential
the WebView holds, minted fresh on every open and expiring in five
minutes. Navigation stays on the content origin; other links open in
the system browser. The source edits in a plain text screen with
explicit saves — whole-file, last-write-wins, with the server parking
the diverged version as a conflict copy the save's notice names, with
a Resolve button into the conflict screen. Trust shows as a read-only badge; it changes on the web. An
instrumented test (`NoteWebViewSandboxTest`) runs a hostile note on a
device and checks that its script cannot fetch the API, read the app
origin's cookies, or navigate the WebView off the content origin, and
that a trusted note's canvas animation runs. The minted view URL and
the source saves go through `NoteRepository` like everything else, so
an HTML note offline reads as its cached source until the server
returns.

## The CRDT engine

`crdt/` is where the AAR that `make android-crdt` builds from
`mobile/crdt` lands (`crdt/libs/yana-crdt.aar`; see
[mobile/crdt/README.md](../mobile/crdt/README.md)). The AAR is a build
artifact and not committed. The `:crdt` project publishes it as its
only artifact, so the app's `implementation(project(":crdt"))` picks up
its classes and native libraries when it is there and nothing when it
is not. The realtime sync layer (`data/rt/`) calls into it through the
`RtDocFactory` seam, behind which the JVM tests substitute a fake — so
build the AAR before `./gradlew build`, which CI does.

## Identity

The UI face is Source Sans 3, a humanist sans. Mono (Source Code Pro)
is used only for the `YANA/` wordmark and code. Colours are the web
client's tokens: warm off-white, near-black ink, one amber accent, with
light and dark variants. Settings can follow the system or pin one. The
launcher icon is the slash from the wordmark. Both fonts are under the
SIL Open Font License; the texts are in `fonts/`.
