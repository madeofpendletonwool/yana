YANA/ keeps a directory of `.md` files, and gives you a fast, quiet web app
on top of it: live sync between every device, wikilinks and backlinks,
tasks you tick from your phone and gather on one page, a daily note, git
history, sharing by
folder, and an MCP endpoint so an agent can document your network while
you sleep. Open the same files in any editor, `mv` them, `rsync` them,
`grep` them. Delete the app's database and it rebuilds from the tree.

None of this is novel. That's sort of the point.

## What it does

**Writing.** Markdown, rendered as you would expect: headings, lists,
tables, code with highlighting, footnotes, task boxes, plus mermaid
diagrams, callouts and math, drawn offline. A note opens to
read; press **E** to edit, **Esc** to go back. Split mode shows the
editor and the rendered page side by side. Formatting buttons sit in the
toolbar on a desktop and above the keyboard on a phone, so nobody has to
know the syntax to use it. Undo is yours alone, even with someone else
in the same note.

**Linking.** `[[Note name]]` links to a note; type `[[` and pick from the
list. Every note shows what links to it. A link to a note that does not
exist yet is a create button. Rename or move a note and every link to it
is rewritten, on disk and in open editors. `#tags` are clickable, each
has a page, and the switcher finds notes by tag.

![Split mode: the editor on the left with the formatting buttons and a wikilink completion popup, the rendered note on the right](images/screenshots/editing.png)

**Sync.** Each note is a CRDT document that stays in step with its file
in both directions. Two people in one note see each other type, with
presence and cursors. Edit the file with vim, `echo >>` a line, or
`rsync` a folder in, and the change merges into whoever has it open.
Kill the server mid-sentence or write offline for a day; it converges on
reconnect, with no conflict dialog.

**Capture.** New note starts in the folder you are looking at: type a
name and press Enter, or Tab into another folder first, the way a shell
completes a path. **Today** opens the daily note, made from a
template if you keep one. **Capture** appends one line to today's note
without opening it — from the home screen, the phone's bottom bar, or the
share sheet.

**On a phone.** Install it from the browser and it is a home-screen app
that works offline: the tree, recent notes, and every note you have
opened are on the device, and changes that need the server queue until
it is back. Long-press for folder actions; a bar of formatting buttons
sits above the keyboard.

![Three phone screens: the home screen with New note, Capture and Today; a note being read with its task boxes; the same note in the editor with the formatting bar above the keyboard](images/screenshots/phone.png)

**Finding things.** Full-text search over titles and bodies with
operators — `tag:`, `path:`, `space:`, `is:untagged`, `is:task`,
`is:html`, `has:image`, `has:attachment`, `author:`, `before:`, `after:`,
a `-` to exclude and quotes for a phrase — plus regex search
over the files (with ripgrep), a switcher that opens a note by name or
tag, recents and pins on the home screen, saved searches pinned to the
sidebar, and a command palette that
lists everything the app can do. A PDF dropped into a note is searched
too — its text, extracted in the background, turns up alongside notes.

**History.** The notes root is a git repository. The server commits after
the tree has been quiet; edits by people and edits by agents are
distinguishable by author. Every note has a revision list, diffs, and
restore in the Details panel. Optional backup remotes push the history
on a schedule, and a backup restores the whole tree from settings — or
clones itself back onto an empty volume on first start.

**What changed.** The activity page reads that same history as a feed:
who changed which notes, when, grouped by day. An agent's overnight run
shows as one entry, the home screen carries a count of changes since
you last looked, and a folder's menu opens the feed narrowed to that
folder. Every entry carries a restore: the whole tree, or just that
space, back to how it stood — previewed exactly, one file at a time,
before anything moves. The restore lands as its own commit, the state
it replaced is tagged, and what it removes goes to the trash, so it is
itself undoable.

**Sharing.** Accounts gate every route; the first visit creates the
owner and there are no default credentials. Each top-level folder is a
*space*, and a space's members and their roles are listed in its
`.space.yml`. The tree, search, exports and live subscriptions never
cross a space boundary a member cannot see. Settings pages cover
accounts, spaces, sessions and agent keys without touching a file.

**Deletion is soft.** A deleted note moves to `.trash/` with its edit
history for thirty days and comes back from the Trash page, original path
and all. A note `rm`'d from a shell comes back too. Emptying the trash
is the only permanent destruction. Settings → Data lists deleted notes
with what a restore would use — the trash copy while it lasts, the
history after that.

**Everything exports.** One note as a self-contained HTML file. A space or
subtree as a static site with navigation, working links, backlinks and
offline search. The whole tree as a zip that round-trips ids, links and
structure byte for byte.

**Share one note by link.** "Share a link" in a note's menu gives it an
unguessable address that anyone opens with no account, on a phone, with
its pictures. Copy it, scan the QR code, or hand it to the share sheet;
set it to stop after a day or a week; revoke it and it is gone at once.
A globe marks a shared note, and the Data page lists every live link.

**HTML notes.** A `.html` file in the tree is a note too, rendered on a
separate origin in a sandboxed frame — sanitized by default, run as
written only after you mark it trusted.

**Two themes.** Light and dark, following the system or set by hand, with
text size, line width and density in Appearance.

## Agents

Two doors for an agent, both ending in the same place: every write is
merged into the note's document, shown live to open clients, written to
the file, and committed to git under an identifiable author.

- **Files.** Bind-mount the tree (or one space) into the agent's
  container. It reads with `rg` and `cat`, writes `.md` files, links
  them with `[[wikilinks]]`, and the server picks everything up: indexed,
  resolved, backlinked. Per space, a `CONVENTIONS.md` tells the agent how
  you like things.
- **MCP.** `/mcp` with a space-scoped, revocable agent token from
  Settings → Agents, for agents that run somewhere else. Writes are rate
  limited and attributed to the token's label.

Details in [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/madeofpendletonwool/yana && cd yana
mkdir notes
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. The first visit creates the owner account
and seeds a **Start here** note that shows every feature by using it.
Notes live in `./notes` next to the compose file; drop `.md` files into
`./notes/<space>/` and they appear on the next scan. Files stay owned by
you.

Prebuilt images: `ghcr.io/madeofpendletonwool/yana` (`latest`, or a commit
SHA). Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to change the ports or point the
volume at a folder of markdown you already have. HTML notes render from a
second port (`8081` by default); behind a reverse proxy give it its own
hostname ([docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)).

Without a container, with Go 1.26+ and Node 20+:

```sh
make build                       # web client + static binary
YANA_NOTES_ROOT=~/notes ./yana   # default is ~/.yana
```

Install `rg` (ripgrep) for regex search; without it the rest still works.

Configuration is by environment variable (`YANA_NOTES_ROOT`, `YANA_LISTEN`,
`YANA_GIT`, `YANA_LOG_LEVEL`, ...) or a YAML file named by `YANA_CONFIG`.
`.env.example` lists every key with its default.

## On disk

```
<notes root>/
  <space>/
    .space.yml           # members and roles
    CONVENTIONS.md       # optional: how agents should write here
    <folders...>/<note>.md
    <folders...>/_assets/<file>
  .trash/                # soft-deleted notes, in their own structure
  .sync/                 # derived state
    index.db             # the index and the CRDT edit log; safe to delete
    crdt/<id>.bin        # each note's document; keep it to keep edit history
  .git/                  # the history
```

The server writes exactly two keys of frontmatter into a note, once, and
never anything else:

```yaml
---
id: 01JQ8X4K2M9P7R3T5V6W8Y0Z1A   # ULID, assigned on first sight, never changes
created: 2026-09-12T14:02:11Z
---
```

Keys you add are left byte for byte as you wrote them; a short list of
optional ones (`order`, `trusted`) is read if present. The full contract
— wikilinks, assets, what scripts and agents may write — is in
[docs/file-format.md](docs/file-format.md).

### Invariants

These hold in every version. If a change would break one, the change is
wrong.

1. **The filesystem is the source of truth.** Delete `.sync/index.db`,
   restart, and everything is rebuilt by walking the tree.
2. **Files are honest.** A note is a `.md` (or `.html`) file at a real
   path, readable and editable with any text editor.
3. **Folders are folders.** Real nested directories. No tags-as-folders,
   no hidden ordering files.
4. **Concurrent edits converge.** Two clients plus an external file write
   to the same note end up with the same text, with no conflict dialog.
5. **The server does not understand documents.** It relays opaque CRDT
   updates and persists them. Merge logic lives in the client library.
6. **Everything is exportable.** At any moment you can walk away with the
   tree and lose nothing but edit history.

## Development

```sh
make web        # build the browser client into web/dist
make build      # embed it and build ./yana
make test       # go test ./... and the web typecheck
make lint       # gofmt and go vet
make docker     # build the image locally
make android-crdt  # build the Android CRDT AAR into android/crdt/libs
cd android && ./gradlew build  # the Android app: lint, unit tests, APKs
```

One Go binary with the web client embedded. `cmd/yana` is the entry
point; `internal/` holds the server (`pathsafe` is the only way a string
becomes a filesystem path, `reconcile` keeps documents, files and the
index in step, `rt` is the realtime relay, `mcp` the agent endpoint,
`git` the history layer, `guide` the starter notes); `web/` is the Preact
and CodeMirror client; `mobile/crdt` is the bind package behind the
Android client's CRDT engine ([mobile/crdt/README.md](mobile/crdt/README.md));
`android/` is the Android app ([android/README.md](android/README.md));
`spike/crdt/` is the CRDT evaluation harness the design started from.

The reconciliation tests include a 60 second oscillation check and a
process-kill check; the relay tests include a server-restart convergence
check and a 20-connection load check; `go test -short ./...` shrinks the
former. The CRDT spike's cross-language tests need `node` and `npm ci`
in `spike/crdt/js`; without them those tests skip.

Work happens on short-lived branches off `main`, with Conventional Commit
messages and a pull request per change. CI runs gofmt, vet, build, tests,
the web typecheck, and a container smoke test on every pull request,
plus the Android build when `android/` changes; merges to `main`
publish the image.

## Roadmap

Planned next, roughly in order: importers for markdown vaults and Notion
exports; templates with variables; vim keys; and the rest of the
Android app — an offline replica and search, realtime sync, the editor,
and capture from the share sheet, a tile and a widget. It signs in and
browses today.
